The first dimension table will contain events from the I94 immigration data. The columns below will be extracted from the immigration dataframe:

i94yr = 4 digit year
i94mon = numeric month
i94cit = 3 digit code of origin city
i94port = 3 character code of destination city
arrdate = arrival date
i94mode = 1 digit travel code
depdate = departure date
i94visa = reason for immigration

The second dimension table will contain city temperature data. The columns below will be extracted from the temperature dataframe:

i94port = 3 character code of destination city (mapped from immigration data during cleanup step)
AverageTemperature = average temperature
City = city name
Country = country name
Latitude= latitude
Longitude = longitude

The fact table will contain information from the I94 immigration data joined with the city temperature data on i94port:

i94yr = 4 digit year
i94mon = numeric month
i94cit = 3 digit code of origin city
i94port = 3 character code of destination city
arrdate = arrival date
i94mode = 1 digit travel code
depdate = departure date
i94visa = reason for immigration
AverageTemperature = average temperature of destination city
