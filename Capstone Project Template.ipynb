    "#### Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create an ETL pipeline using I94 immigration data and city temperature data to form a database that is optimized for queries on immigration events. This database can be used to answer questions relating immigration behavior to destination temperature e.g., do people tend to immigrate to warmer places?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be looking at the immigration data for the united states. More specifically, we're interested in looking at the following phenomena:\n",
    "\n",
    "the effects of temperature on the volume of travellers,\n",
    "the seasonality of travel\n",
    "the connection between the volume of travel and the number of entry ports (ie airports)\n",
    "the connection between the volume of travel and the demographics of various cities\n",
    "To accomplish this study, we will be using the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "I94 Immigration Data: This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office and includes the contents of the i94 form on entry to the united states. A data dictionary is included in the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "countries.csv : table containing country codes used in the dataset, extracted from the data dictionary\n",
    "i94portCodes.csv: table containing city codes used in the dataset, extracted from the data dictionary\n",
    "World Temperature Data: This dataset comes from Kaggle and includes the temperatures of various cities in the world fomr 1743 to 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "U.S. City Demographic Data: This data comes from OpenSoft. It contains information about the demographics of all US cities and census-designated places with a population greater or equal to 65,000 and comes from the US Census Bureau's 2015 American Community Survey.\n",
    "Airport Code Table: This is a simple table of airport codes and corresponding cities.\n",
    "In order to accomplish this, we will aggregate our data as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "aggregate based on time (year, month, day, etc...)\n",
    "aggregate data by cities and airports\n",
    "look at the impact of temperatures on the in and ouflux of travelers\n",
    "the impact on regional demographics\n",
    "\n",
    "The project follows the follow steps:\n",
    "* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data\n",
    "* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "* Step 3: Define the Data Model\n",

Next we will aggregate city temperature data by city to form the second dimension table. The two datasets will be joined on destination city to form the fact table.
